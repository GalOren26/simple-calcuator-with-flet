# Functionality
1. Regular calculations.
2. Solving any type of equation with one variable-  
3. Solving linear equations by placing coefficients.
4. Choosing 2 days from a calendar and calculating the number of days between them.

Modes 1 to 3 work separately. The transition between modes is made by pressing the relevant button -

state where no button is pressed corresponds to the mode of a normal equation.

The current state can be seen in the first row of the calculator as well as the brightness of the button representing its image.
